  <H3>Running Test</H3>
  <H4>All New Beta Grippers Must Pass This</H4>
  <p>This test should only be run on grippers with fingertips connected. It will check the connections of the fingertip sensors. </p>
  <H4>Pre Burn-In</H4>
  <p>If you are testing a gripper after burn in, cancel and select "Gripper Test - Post Burn-in" from the menu. This test is for fresh grippers only.</p>
<H3>Connecting the Gripper</H3>
<p>Make sure the gripper is fully secured in the gripper test fixture. Plug the cable from the test fixture into the small plug on the gripper board, through the back of the gripper. </p>

<H3>Testing the Gripper</H3>
<H4>Do not touch the gripper unless prompted</H4>
<p>Do not interfere with the gripper when it is calibrating, as it may cause the gripper to set its zero position early. Once the gripper fully closes, move it around and watch the visualizer.</p>
<p>The only time you should touch the gripper is while the visualizer is open, and after the gripper is closed. <b>Touching the gripper may cause it to fail its test.</b></p>
<p><b>Press 'Continue' to proceed.</b></p>
