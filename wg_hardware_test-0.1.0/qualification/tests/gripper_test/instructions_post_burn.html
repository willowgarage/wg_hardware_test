  <H3>Running Test</H3>
  <H4>Post Burn-in Grippers Only</H4>
  <p>This test should only be run on grippers after they have completed burn in. If the gripper has sensors, click "Cancel" and select "Gripper Test" from the menu. <b>All new grippers must be qualified with the "Gripper Test", with tips.</b></p>
  <H3>Connecting the Gripper</H3>
  <p>Make sure the gripper is fully secured in the gripper test fixture. Plug the cable from the test fixture into the small plug on the gripper board, through the back of the gripper. </p>

  <H3>Check for Debris</H3>
  <p>Check for any debris in the gears of the gripper. If the gripper has any debris or damage, reject it and report.</p>
  <H3>Installing Fingertips</H3>
  <p>This gripper should NOT have fingertips installed. It will fail if fingertips are installed.</p>
  <H3>Testing the Gripper</H3>
  <H4>Do not touch the gripper unless prompted</H4>
  <p>Do not interfere with the gripper when it is calibrating, as it may cause the gripper to set its zero position early. Once the gripper fully closes, move it around and watch the visualizer.</p>
  <p>The only time you should touch the gripper is while the visualizer is open, and after the gripper is closed. <b>Touching the gripper may cause it to fail its test.</b></p>
  <p><b>Press 'Continue' to proceed.</b></p>
