  <H2 align=center>Head Tilt Motor</H2>
  <H4>This should be run on partially assembled motors only</H4>
  <p>All motors must run through EE motor test before this test. Motors must have caster coupler and gears installed before this test.</p>
  <H3>Connecting Motor</H3>
  <p><b>You must be grounded for the this step.</b></p>
  <p>Make sure the encoder and motor power cables from the MCB to the motor are connected. <b>The tilt drive belt must be removed.</b></p>
  <p>Connect the green EtherCAT cable from the qualification bench to the MCB. Make sure the red and black power cable from the MCB to the power board is connected.</p>

  <p><b>Remove the left ethercat cable from the MCB as shown.</b></p>
  <H3>Testing the Motor</H3>
  <p>This test will run the motor through a hysteresis test. Afterwards, it may ask you to examine the results. You will see a plot of motor effort versus position, and a plot of velocity versus position. If you examine this result, make sure of two things:<br>
  <b>*</b> Motor effort is even, no rough patches.<br>
  <b>*</b> The velocity plot does not touch zero. If it does, this could be caused by a scratch on the encoder.<br>
 If you have any doubt about the quality of the motor, <b>press "Fail"</b>. Do not pass any component you are unsure of.</p>
<p><b>Press 'Continue' to proceed.</b></p>
