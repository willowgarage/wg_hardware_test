<H3>Connecting</H3>
<p>Since there is no hardware, you do not need to connect anything.</p>
<H3>Running Test</H3>
<p>This simple example launches three tests, a prestartup test, a startup script and a shutdown script. 
<br>The pretest launches a dialog with OK/Cancel buttons.
<br>Startup script calls a test node.
<br>The first test passes automatically, and a launches a dialog as a post test.
<br>The second tests requests human analysis. Click "Pass" when you see the results.
<br>The third test fails automatically.
<br>The shutdown script is empty.</p>
<p>At the end, you should see the results of all three tests. Click through them and take a look.</p>
